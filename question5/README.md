## Question 5

Find an interesting statistic and create a structure in C storing those statistics. Write 2 functions that does interesting analystics for those statistics. Be sure to print out these analytics.

For example, the top 25 snow storms in NYC can be stored in a structure containing the month, day, year and the number of inches it snowed. Two functions could be to find the average of the top snow storms and to sort the snowstorms starting with the most recent.

Note: You may hard code these statistics in a global or in your main.

Bonus (+5 points): Find an actual data file that you ingest with your program using functions like fopen from chapter7.
